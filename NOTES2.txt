note:a global approach to feature extraction, which is that a model trained using a feature vector of the entire face instead of its geometrical components
makes it less robust to angle and orientation changes. However, when the variation in facial orientation is not large, the
global-approach is still very accurate and simpler to implement than component-based approaches.
